# Introduction

This document will walk you through the "cobolDocDemo1" implementation in the <SwmPath>[cblfile.cbl](/cblfile.cbl)</SwmPath> file. The purpose of this program is to process customer records and generate reports. We will cover:

1. How files are selected and organized.
2. The structure and layout of customer records.
3. The main processing routine and its components.
4. The initialization and cleanup processes.
5. The logic for processing and updating customer records.

# File selection and organization

<SwmSnippet path="/cblfile.cbl" line="15">

---

The program selects and organizes files for processing customer data and generating reports. The <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="18:3:5" line-data="           SELECT CUSTOMER-FILE ASSIGN TO &#39;CUSTOMER.DAT&#39;">`CUSTOMER-FILE`</SwmToken> is indexed and accessed dynamically, allowing efficient retrieval and update of records using the <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="21:7:9" line-data="               RECORD KEY IS CUSTOMER-ID">`CUSTOMER-ID`</SwmToken> as the key. This setup is crucial for handling large datasets with unique identifiers.

```
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
       FILE-CONTROL.
           SELECT CUSTOMER-FILE ASSIGN TO 'CUSTOMER.DAT'
               ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED
               ACCESS MODE IS DYNAMIC
               RECORD KEY IS CUSTOMER-ID
               FILE STATUS IS FILE-STATUS.
```

<SwmSnippet path="/cblfile.cbl" line="24">

The <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="24:3:5" line-data="           SELECT REPORT-FILE ASSIGN TO &#39;REPORT.DAT&#39;">`REPORT-FILE`</SwmToken> is organized sequentially, which is suitable for generating reports that are processed in order.

```
           SELECT REPORT-FILE ASSIGN TO 'REPORT.DAT'
               ORGANIZATION IS SEQUENTIAL.
```

# Customer record layout

<SwmSnippet path="/cblfile.cbl" line="30">

---

The customer record layout defines the structure of the data being processed. Each record includes fields such as <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="31:3:5" line-data="      * CUSTOMER-ID:    9(6) - Unique identifier for each customer">`CUSTOMER-ID`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="32:3:5" line-data="      * CUST-NAME:      X(30) - Customer full name">`CUST-NAME`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="33:3:5" line-data="      * CUST-ADDRESS:   X(50) - Customer street address">`CUST-ADDRESS`</SwmToken>, <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="34:3:5" line-data="      * CUST-PHONE:     X(15) - Contact phone number">`CUST-PHONE`</SwmToken>, and <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="35:3:5" line-data="      * CUST-BALANCE:   9(7)V99 - Current account balance">`CUST-BALANCE`</SwmToken>. This layout ensures that all necessary customer information is captured and stored in a standardized format.

```
      * Customer Record Layout
      * CUSTOMER-ID:    9(6) - Unique identifier for each customer
      * CUST-NAME:      X(30) - Customer full name
      * CUST-ADDRESS:   X(50) - Customer street address
      * CUST-PHONE:     X(15) - Contact phone number
      * CUST-BALANCE:   9(7)V99 - Current account balance
      ******************************************************************
       FD CUSTOMER-FILE.
       01 CUSTOMER-RECORD.
           05 CUSTOMER-ID       PIC 9(6).
           05 CUST-NAME        PIC X(30).
           05 CUST-ADDRESS     PIC X(50).
           05 CUST-PHONE       PIC X(15).
           05 CUST-BALANCE     PIC 9(7)V99.
```

# Main processing routine

<SwmSnippet path="/cblfile.cbl" line="57">

---

The main processing routine controls the program flow, initializing the environment, processing records, and performing cleanup. This routine is the backbone of the program, ensuring that each step is executed in sequence.

```
      * Main processing routine that controls program flow
      * - Initializes the processing environment
      * - Processes all customer records
      * - Performs cleanup and creates final report
      ******************************************************************
       MAIN-PROCESS.
           PERFORM INITIALIZATION
           PERFORM PROCESS-RECORDS UNTIL END-OF-FILE
           PERFORM CLEANUP
           STOP RUN.
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Initialization and cleanup

<SwmSnippet path="/cblfile.cbl" line="68">

---

Initialization opens the required files and sets up working storage variables, preparing the environment for processing.

```
      ******************************************************************
      * INITIALIZATION
      * Opens required files and initializes working storage variables
      ******************************************************************
       INITIALIZATION.
           OPEN I-O CUSTOMER-FILE
           OPEN OUTPUT REPORT-FILE
           INITIALIZE WS-COUNTERS.
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/cblfile.cbl" line="103">

---

Cleanup closes the files and generates a processing summary, ensuring that resources are released and final outputs are created.

```
      ******************************************************************
      * CLEANUP
      * Performs end-of-job processing
      * - Closes files
      * - Generates processing summary
      ******************************************************************
       CLEANUP.
           CLOSE CUSTOMER-FILE
           CLOSE REPORT-FILE.
```

# Processing and updating records

<SwmSnippet path="/cblfile.cbl" line="77">

---

The <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="78:3:5" line-data="      * PROCESS-RECORDS">`PROCESS-RECORDS`</SwmToken> section reads and processes each customer record, updating balances and maintaining counter information. This section is vital for iterating over the dataset and applying necessary updates.

```
      ******************************************************************
      * PROCESS-RECORDS
      * Reads and processes each customer record
      * Updates balances and maintains counter information
      ******************************************************************
       PROCESS-RECORDS.
           READ CUSTOMER-FILE
               AT END SET END-OF-FILE TO TRUE
               NOT AT END
                   ADD 1 TO RECORDS-READ
                   PERFORM UPDATE-CUSTOMER-RECORD
           END-READ.
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/cblfile.cbl" line="90">

---

The <SwmToken path="/cblfile.cbl" pos="91:3:7" line-data="      * UPDATE-CUSTOMER-RECORD">`UPDATE-CUSTOMER-RECORD`</SwmToken> section applies business rules to update individual customer records, such as applying service charges and updating customer status. This logic is essential for maintaining accurate and up-to-date customer information.

```
      ******************************************************************
      * UPDATE-CUSTOMER-RECORD
      * Updates individual customer record based on business rules
      * - Applies service charges if applicable
      * - Updates customer status
      ******************************************************************
       UPDATE-CUSTOMER-RECORD.
           IF CUST-BALANCE < ZERO
               ADD 25.00 TO CUST-BALANCE
               REWRITE CUSTOMER-RECORD
               ADD 1 TO RECORDS-UPDATED
           END-IF.
```
